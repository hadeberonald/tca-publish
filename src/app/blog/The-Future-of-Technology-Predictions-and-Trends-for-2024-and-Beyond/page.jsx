                <h2 className={styles.h2}>5G will become more widespread</h2>

                <p>5G is unleashing a new era of lightning-fast connectivity. With blazing speeds and near real-time response times, 5G opens the door to innovations like autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things, and immersive extended realities. This is not just an incremental upgrade - 5G represents a quantum leap in what's possible with mobile technology. </p>

                <p>By fundamentally transforming how we connect, communicate, and compute, 5G promises to revolutionize our digital experiences and empower breakthrough applications across every industry. The future envisioned by 5G is almost here.</p>

                <h2 className={styles.h2}>Edge computing reduces latency</h2>

                <p>When it comes to data processing, proximity matters. By processing data near the user or device, latency is reduced, allowing for faster response times. This local data processing approach is ideal for emerging technologies like the Internet of Things and autonomous vehicles, where split-second decisions are critical. By enabling real-time data analysis at the edge, we can unlock the full potential of these transformative innovations.</p>

                <h2 className={styles.h2}>Blockchain evolves beyond finance</h2>

                <p>The applications of blockchain technology are vast and far-reaching. From healthcare to supply chain management, real estate to government services, blockchain has the potential to fundamentally transform major industries. </p>
                <p>By providing enhanced security, transparency, and automation, blockchain can streamline processes, reduce fraud, and build trust between parties. Healthcare stands to benefit from more secure and interoperable records management. Supply chains can track assets in real-time across complex networks. Real estate transactions can be executed with greater efficiency and accuracy. And governments can provide better citizen services and electoral systems through blockchain-based identity and voting platforms. </p>
                <p>Though still in its early days, blockchain is poised to be a disruptive force across multiple sectors as more organizations recognize its ability to solve critical data, security, and automation challenges. The possibilities are exciting as blockchain aims to drive the next wave of innovation.</p>

                <h2 className={styles.h2}>Quantum computing inches closer to reality</h2>

                <p>Quantum computing, a revolutionary approach to processing information, has the potential to catalyze breakthroughs across scientific fields. By harnessing the bizarre properties of quantum physics, these powerful machines can solve certain complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers. Experts anticipate that quantum computers will enable dramatic advances in material sciences, drug discovery, artificial intelligence, and more. </p>

               <p> While still in their early stages, quantum computers promise to reshape entire industries and usher in an era of accelerated innovation.</p>

               <h2 className={styles.h2}>Startups lead the way on quantum</h2>
               
               <p>A quantum computing race is underway between tech giants and startups alike. Google, IBM, and a slew of emerging companies are all vying to be the first to create a practical quantum computer. While the technology shows immense promise, experts estimate quantum computers are still 5-10 years away from widespread business applications. Nonetheless, the possibilities are intriguing. </p>
               <p>Quantum computers harness the power of quantum physics, enabling them to process information in completely new ways compared to classical computers. This opens the door to solving complex problems far beyond the capabilities of current supercomputers. </p>

               <p>The race is on to see who can successfully tame the potential of quantum first. When these exotic machines arrive, they are set to transform everything from drug design to financial modeling and security. The future of computing is quantum.</p>
